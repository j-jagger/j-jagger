# Hello, I'm Joe.

I'm a British amateur programmer / administrator, with heavy experience in Python, Bash, and HTML/CSS, if those count.
I also have experience in Proxmox VE, Windows Server, General UNIX operations, and I'm in the progress of learning C++, Rust, and on the side, C + C# and a bit of JS.
